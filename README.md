# Warehouse Wreckage (UE5 Learning Project)

## Description
This is the first UE5 project created by me as part of the Udemy UE5 game development course. This project is entirely built using the Blueprint visual programming language. In this game, players can explore a warehouse and shoot moving objects in the scene with projectiles.

## What I've Learned
- Blueprint basics: nodes, pins, variables, functions, data types, branches, etc.
- Unreal basics: maps, actors, scene, transforms, vectors, etc.
- Creating custom Blueprint classes
- Level creation using primitive objects (basic shapes with addition/subtraction modes, blocking volumes)
- Working with physics (mass, CCD, impulse)
- Basic UI creation with dynamically changing text
- Handling input from the player
